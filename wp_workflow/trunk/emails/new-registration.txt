WELCOME TO FIRM GAINS

Dear ${mailData.get('contact.firstName')}

Thank you for registering with Firm Gains, we believe that this will be your first step to a brighter future. Whether you are in the early stages of considering investment, or in the final negotiation, we believe the resources we put at your disposal will give you the confidence and edge to secure the best possible future for you, your business and your family.

Learning Experiences
The truth is that most of what is shared on Firm Gains contains lessons learned from mistakes made and, sometimes bitter, experience. Running a successful business is one skill, selling it successfully is a completely different matter. The pain experienced by falling at that final hurdle is only exacerbated by the 'if only... ' recriminations that follow. We want to help you to avoid the potential pitfalls.

An Independent Voice
So, we recognised that business leaders, however experienced, need help in this process. Regardless of size of company, you still need to make smart choices along the way. Sometimes this means taking a timeout to consider carefully on your own, other times it will be by seeking advice and the counsel of others.

Assistance: When You Need It
We also realise there's only so much a website can offer. Much of the advice on this site is general, because it needs to be relevant for as many business owners as possible.

At the same time, if you need specific advice or help based on particular circumstances, or if you want help in making the most informed choice when it comes to partnering with the right business broker or, possibly, legal support, then that's where you can contact us direct.

At any time, simply call 01962 609 000 and speak to us with 100% confidentiality about your present situation and we will help find the right match for you.

If we can help you make all the 'little wins' you need, then we are confident that you will achieve the best possible end result.

Good luck!
