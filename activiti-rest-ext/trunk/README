From Activiti 5.13's REST rewrite the REST client is sufficient for many tasks 
but unfortunately it still uses a Restlet architecture that does not lend itself 
to simple extensions. So this is a reduced set of the previous 'bbc-explorer' 
containing just what needs to be added to support the Know Process HTML client.
