History
-------

From Activiti 5.13's REST rewrite the REST client is sufficient for many tasks 
but unfortunately it still uses a Restlet architecture that does not lend itself 
to simple extensions. So this is a reduced set of the previous 'bbc-explorer' 
containing just what needs to be added to support the Know Process HTML client.

Known Issues
------------

0.1.0 - 28 Jan 14 - revision ??
-------------------------------
- UserProfileResource (/ext/profile): GET and PUT all user, group and userinfo 
  in one request.
- MessageResource (/msg/{bpmnMsgName}): PUT starts new process by message. By 
  convention the message name should be namespace.descriptiveName. Message 
  itself is passed to process as string (e.g. suitable for parsing as JSON).
- DeploymentResource (/msg/repository/deployments): 
  - POST that will accept a multi-part upload (bpmn or other resource files).
  - POST that accepts URL encoded form to specify a BPMN URL resource to put
    through the UrlDeploymentProcess.
