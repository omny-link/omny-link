History
-------

From Activiti 5.13's REST rewrite the REST client is sufficient for many tasks 
but unfortunately it still uses a Restlet architecture that does not lend itself 
to simple extensions. So this is a reduced set of the previous 'bbc-explorer' 
containing just what needs to be added to support the Know Process HTML client.

Known Issues

0.1 - ? - revision ??
---------------------
- UserProfileResource (/ext/profile): GET and PUT all user, group and userinfo 
  in one request.
- MessageResource (/msg/{bpmnMsgName}): PUT starts new process by message. By 
  convention the message name should be namespace.descriptiveName. Message 
  itself is passed to process as string (e.g. suiutable for parsing as JSON).
