=== icon:check-circle-o[] Raise Support Ticket

==== Actor

End user of the system, typically an employee of a reporting organisation

==== User story

Two main reasons could lead the user to need to raise a support ticket: 

* The system is behaving in an unexpected way, possibly as a result of a bug or 
simply because the user does not understand it in some way. Termed 'Application'
problem.
* The user has a question regarding the requested data or wishes to have it 
presented out in a different way. These are Data problems.

It is possible to record support tickets directly within the system including: 

* A short description of the problem  
* A screenshot of the application's current state
* Category of problem as above: Application, Data, Other

==== User outcome

The user receives an email confirming the ticket's submission and the ticket
is placed into the task queue of one or more groups of users, based on the 
category of the problem.
