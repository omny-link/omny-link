=== HOWTO edit user interface strings

==== Overview

One of the big advantages of Omny for clients is that they can see the user 
interface in their own terminology. Omny has a similar mechanism to that used in
localisation. 

==== Details

. Find the `strings` section of the tenant configuration file. 

. Each string entry consists of a key-value pair. The key (used in the code)
is on the left and the value (displayed to the user) is on the right. For example:
+
[source,json]
----
  { "account": "School" }
----

NOTE: It is only necessary to define terms that the client wishes to override.
