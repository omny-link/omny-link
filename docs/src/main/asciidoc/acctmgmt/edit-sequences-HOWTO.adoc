=== HOWTO edit sequences

==== Overview

Sequences (also known as number fountains) have these characteristics:

 - positive integers starting at a specifiable number per field & tenant combo
 - unique
 - contiguous (incrementing by exactly 1 each time, no gaps)

In contrast database identifiers may be generated and unique but cannot be
guaranteed contiguous or offer control over where they start from. 

==== Details

. Find the `sequences` section and check if the expected list is present
or if not create it. Each list looks like this:
+
[source,json]
----
  { "name": "Invoice Number", "ref": "Order", "description": "A sequence to allocate invoice reference numbers" }
----
+ 
`name` and `description` are human-readable entries to describe the sequence. 
`ref` is the name of the busiess entity that the sequence will apply to.
. View the https://api.omny.link/status.html[status page] to check the configuration is as you expect.
