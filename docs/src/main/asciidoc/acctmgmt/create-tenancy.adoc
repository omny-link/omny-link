=== icon:check-circle-o[] Create Tenancy

Actor: Omny Staff

==== User story

After preliminary discussions, proposal and demo the client is ready to make a 
commitment. This process supplies the necessary information to configure Omny
for the new client (a.k.a create their tenancy). 

We aim to reach this commitment point 'quickly' and as such it excludes custom
or roadmap features.   

==== User outcome

We (Omny) can tell the client an estimated date that the system will be 
available. Depending on the user stories required follow-up questionnaires 
may be issued. Content of these questionnaires is described in the relevant 
stories. 

For the time being this provisioning process is manual but over time 
we will seek to automate parts.  

==== Pre-requisites

None.

==== Order Form
