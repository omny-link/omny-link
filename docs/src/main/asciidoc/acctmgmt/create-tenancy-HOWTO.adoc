embedding the customisations. The http://code.knowprocess.com/tstephen/platform/tree/master/work-mgmt/src/main/resources/static/tenants/acme.json[ACME configuration] is a good 
example to copy and paste.
+
This file needs to be served from a web server somewhere. Assuming we host the
client website then by convention is is stored within the WordPress theme for 
example: 
+
 http://acme.com/wp-content/themes/acme/tenant-config.json
+
In any case the URL must be registered in the tenant record (above).  

TIP: After making changes to the tenant configuration ensure you visit 
https://api.omny.link/status.html[the status page] to ensure everything is 
working as expected.

  - custom HTML layouts for custom fields (which by default are laid out in two columns)
