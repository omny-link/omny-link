=== HOWTO enable and disable standard sections

==== Overview

Several sections (and even down to individual fields in some cases) are not
applicable to every client and so can be enabled and disabled as needed.

These are controlled within the `features` (formerly named `show`) section of the
tenant configuration file. What follows is a list of simple booleans either
enabling or disabling one aspect of the user interface. Note this is not the
security implementation but simply a means to show the each user the
appropriate fields.
