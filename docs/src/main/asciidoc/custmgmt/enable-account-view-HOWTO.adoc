=== HOWTO enable account view

==== Overview

This entails adding the necessary settings to the tenant config file, see 
<<howto-manage-tenant-config>> for details and checking both the account page 
and the status page to see that all the configured items are deployed and working.

==== Details

. Add account view to the toolbar element. Typically this should be one of the top items.
+
[source,json]
-------
{ "url": "accounts.html", "classes": "glyphicon omny-icon-address-book", "description": "Find and manage a particular account", "title": "Account Management" }
-------
NOTE: replace 'account' with the terminology that the client uses. 
+ 
On logging in and having ensured the updated tenant config is loaded you will
see the new entry in the toolbar and on clicking the top of the page will look
something like this:
+

. Add custom fields to the accountFields section. Each field looks like:
+
[source,json]
-------
{ "name": "camelCaseName", "label": "Short Label Initial Caps", "hint": "Single sentence description explaining what the user should enter" },
-------

. Add any requested actions to the accountActions section.
+
[source,json]
-------
{ "name": "Add task", "ref": "SimpleToDo", "url": true }
-------
+
Review the account page to see that your new action appears in the drop down 
menu.

. Each account action needs a form configured in the partials section. `xxx` 
represents the tenant id and must be followed by the `ref` value from the 
accountActions section. `Url` will either be one of the standard options (as 
here) or will need to be specified and written specifically for each client.  
+
[source,json]
-------
{ "name": "xxxSimpleToDo", "url": "/partials/simple-todo.html"}
-------

. Furthermore, each account action needs a process that will be activated when 
the custom action form is submitted in the `processes` section. The `ref` value 
from the accountActions section needs to match the ref here. Once again `url` 
will either be one of the standard options (as 
here) or will need to be specified and written specifically for each client.  
+
[source,json]
-------
{ "name": "Add task", "ref": "SimpleToDo", "url": "processes/link/omny/casemgmt/SimpleToDo.bpmn" }
-------

. Most (in theory all) of the user interface terminology can be replaced with 
terms the client is more familiar with. These are defined in the `strings` 
section. For details see link:devops.html#howto-edit-strings[here].
+
[source,json]
-------
"strings": {
    "account": "School",
    "accountDescriptionHint": "For example, the Head's name etc.",
    "AccountManagement": "School Management",
    "accounts": "Schools",
    ...
}
-------

. Define values for typeahead lists in the `typeaheadControls` section. `name` is 
optional, but if specified will make the list available to custom JavaScripts.
`selector` is a JQuery selector to identify the field to bind this list to. 
`values` is simply a list of id-name pairs to show in the list. For example:
+
[source,json]
-----
{ 
  "name": "accountTypes", "selector": "#curAccountType", "values": [
    {  "id": "Customer", "name": "Customer"  },
    {  "id": "Partner", "name": "Partner"  },
    {  "id": "Staff", "name": "Staff"  }
  ]
}
-----

. Review the https://api.omny.link[Status page] particularly ensuring that 
any partials and processes are deployed and up to date. The green tick means 
deployed and up to date, yellow warning triangle means an old version is 
deployed, errors are shown with a red x.
