=== HOWTO enable contact management actions

==== Overview

Although actions are often defined specifically for each client there are
some that many clients find useful listed here. Enabling an action consists of
three parts:

. Add the action that will appear in the 'play' button drop down
. (optionally) Specify a partial that will be displayed in the dialogue
. Specify the workflow process that will handle the desired behaviour when the
action dialogue is submitted.

The specific pre-built actions below are available for any client illustrate
how this works in practice.
