=== icon:warning[] Place Order (web form)

Actor: Omny client's client

==== User story

By whatever means, (referral, pay-per-click etc) the user arrives at the order 
form on the client's web site. This form uses the same information as 
specified when <<create-contact,creating a contact>> and 
<<create-order-for-contact,creating an order for a contact>> but it may 
be a subset of that if desired.

==== User outcome

If the web form chooses to include both contact and order in one go then both
are created and linked. If the contact already exists then the order alone may 
be included plus the contact's email address. 

==== Pre-requisites

 * <<create-contact>>
 * <<create-contact-order>>



==== Order Form

Must specify: 

  * Contact and Order fields, including any custom ones, to include in the form
