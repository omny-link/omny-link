=== icon:check-circle-o[] Upload Process Model

Actor: Omny staff or possibly client administrator

==== User story

Workflows or business processes are defined by the industry standard 
http://www.bpmn.org/[Business Process Model and Notation] (BPMN). Many tools 
allow creation of files more or less compliant with this standard that can then 
be uploaded.

[source,gherkin]
------------------
  Given the user has `admin` role
    And the https://api.omny.link/definitions.html page is open
   When the upload button is pressed
   Then the workflow selection panel slides down
   When the user selects a bpmn file and clicks Upload
   Then the process is added to the process repository
------------------

==== User outcome

If the .bpmn file is sufficiently complete for Omny to execute, it will 
be deployed as an executable process, otherwise it will be deployed as a 
documentation-only process with a list of things to address before it can be 
executed.

==== Pre-requisites

 * <<create-tenancy>>

==== Order Form

No particular enablement is required but the user must have the admin role.
