   errors
 * a record of the communication is recorded in the activity log

==== User outcome

Memo is sent to the contact and the activity is recorded.

==== Pre-requisites

 * <<create-tenancy>>
 * <<maintain-template>>

==== Order Form

This story is enabled by adding a contact action to the tenant
configuration.
