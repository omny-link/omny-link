== Publishing

The .adoc files are kept under version control along with the rest of the 
source files. These are the steps to convert them to HTML and publish the 
result on Github-provided hosting.

1. Install pre-requisites: 
  - http://maven.apache.org[Maven]
  - Java
  - git
  
2. Clone source 

  ```
  git clone https://github.com/tstephen/omny-link.git
  ```

We'll use $BASEDIR to refer to the directory where the source is.

3. Move to the docs directory  
  ```
  cd $BASEDIR/docs
  ```
  
4. Generate the documentation 
  ```
  mvn process-resources
  ```
  
5. Move documentation to the gh-pages branch (this is a special branch used by 
Github to publish web pages on https://github.io)
  ```
  git checkout gh-pages
  cd ..
  mv docs/target/generated-docs/*html .
  mv docs/target/generated-docs/*css .
  mv docs/target/generated-docs/images/* images/
  git add *html *css *images
  git commit -m "Regenerated docs"
  git push public
  ```
  
There is a script named `publish-docs.sh` in $BASEDIR that will do this provided you have the pre-reqs installed.
